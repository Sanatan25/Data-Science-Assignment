    "Advantages:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Concurrency: Multithreading allows multiple threads to execute concurrently within a single process. This can lead to \n",
    "better resource utilization and improved responsiveness, particularly in applications that involve I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process share the same memory space, making it easier to share data and \n",
    "resources between threads without the need for complex inter-process communication mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Efficient Communication: Threads can communicate more efficiently compared to processes, as they can directly share data \n",
    "through shared memory. This can lead to reduced overhead in data exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cost-Effective: Threads are more lightweight than processes, requiring less memory and system resources to create and \n",
    "manage. This makes multithreading a more cost-effective approach for concurrent programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Parallelism for Certain Tasks: While the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks in \n",
    "Python, multithreading can still provide benefits for I/O-bound tasks where threads spend a lot of time waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Simplified Programming: Multithreading can simplify certain programming tasks by allowing you to focus on dividing the \n",
    "work into smaller units that can be executed concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complexity: Multithreaded programs can become complex due to the need for proper synchronization mechanisms to avoid race \n",
    "conditions and ensure data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Deadlocks and Race Conditions: Poorly synchronized threads can lead to deadlocks, where threads wait indefinitely for \n",
    "resources that will never be released. Race conditions can result in unpredictable behavior as multiple threads attempt to \n",
    "access shared data simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Debugging and Testing: Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging due to non-deterministic behavior. Issues like\n",
    "race conditions might not be consistently reproducible, making them harder to identify and fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. GIL Limitations: In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) restricts true parallel execution of threads for CPU-bound \n",
    "tasks, potentially limiting the performance benefits of multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Thread Overhead: Threads have some overhead associated with their creation, management, and context switching. Creating \n",
    "too many threads might lead to diminished performance due to this overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Portability: Multithreading behavior can be platform-dependent, which can lead to portability issues when moving code \n",
    "between different systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Limited Scalability: While multithreading can provide performance benefits for certain tasks, it might not scale well \n",
    "for applications that require extensive parallelism across multiple CPU cores."

    "Deadlocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads or processes are unable to proceed with their execution because each is waiting for the other to release a resource. In other words, they're stuck in a circular waiting state. Deadlocks can bring a program to a standstill, as the involved threads cannot progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic example of a deadlock involves two resources (e.g., locks) and two threads:\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread A acquires Resource 1.\n",
    "Thread B acquires Resource 2.\n",
    "Thread A tries to acquire Resource 2 but gets blocked, waiting for Thread B to release it.\n",
    "Thread B tries to acquire Resource 1 but gets blocked, waiting for Thread A to release it.\n",
    "Neither thread can proceed because each is holding one resource that the other needs. This creates a deadlock situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Conditions:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Race conditions occur when multiple threads or processes access shared resources concurrently, and the final outcome depends on the timing and order of their execution. The result is unpredictable and often incorrect behavior, as the threads \"race\" to access and modify the shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple example of a bank account balance that two threads are trying to update concurrently:\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread A reads the current balance as $100.\n",
    "Thread B also reads the balance as $100.\n",
    "Thread A deposits $50 and updates the balance to $150.\n",
    "Thread B deposits $30 and updates the balance to $130 (based on the initial read)."
