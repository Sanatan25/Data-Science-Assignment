    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and \n",
    "manipulation of that data. Databases are used to store information for various applications, ranging from simple data storage to complex data \n",
    "analysis and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two broad categories of database management systems that differ in their data models,\n",
    "design philosophies, and use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Data Model: SQL databases are based on the relational data model, which organizes data into tables with predefined schemas. Each table contains rows\n",
    "(records) and columns (fields).\n",
    "2. Schema: SQL databases have a fixed schema, meaning the structure of the data (tables, columns, data types) must be defined before data insertion. \n",
    "Changes to the schema can be complex and may require downtime.\n",
    "3. Query Language: SQL databases use the SQL language for querying and manipulating data. SQL provides a standardized way to retrieve and modify data \n",
    "using commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.\n",
    "4. Consistency: SQL databases generally enforce strict data consistency and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, making \n",
    "them suitable for applications where data integrity is crucial, such as financial systems.\n",
    "5. Use Cases: SQL databases are well-suited for applications that require complex queries, transactions, and strong data integrity, such as enterprise\n",
    "resource planning (ERP) systems, financial applications, and e-commerce platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Model: NoSQL databases encompass a wide range of data models, including key-value, document, columnar, and graph databases. They are designed \n",
    "to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "2. Schema: NoSQL databases often have a flexible or schema-less approach, allowing data to be stored without a predefined schema. This provides \n",
    "greater agility when dealing with changing data structures.\n",
    "3. Query Language: NoSQL databases typically use non-SQL query languages or APIs specific to their data model. These languages might be less \n",
    "standardized than SQL but are optimized for specific use cases.\n",
    "4. Consistency: NoSQL databases offer a spectrum of consistency models, ranging from eventual consistency\n",
    "(where data may temporarily diverge across nodes but eventually becomes consistent) to strong consistency. The emphasis is often on scalability \n",
    "and performance over strict consistency.\n",
    "5. Use Cases: NoSQL databases excel in applications requiring massive scalability, high availability, and flexibility in data models. Examples\n",
    "include social media platforms, content management systems, real-time analytics, and IoT (Internet of Things) applications."

    "provides libraries and modules that allow you to execute DDL statements against a database using SQL syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create new databases objects, such as tables, views, indexes, or even databases themselves.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "\n",
